=======================
Morphological Filtering
=======================

Morphological image processing is a collection of non-linear operations related
to the shape or morphology of features in an image, such as boundaries,
skeletons, etc. In any given technique, we probe an image with a small shape or
template called a structuring element, which defines the region of interest or
neighborhood around a pixel.

In this document we outline the following basic morphological operations:

1. Erosion
2. Dilation
3. Opening
4. Closing
5. White Tophat
6. Black Tophat
7. Skeletonize
8. Convex Hull


To get started, let's load an image using ``io.imread``. Note that morphology
functions only work on gray-scale or binary images, so we set ``as_gray=True``.



.. code-block:: python


    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from skimage import data
    from skimage.util import img_as_ubyte
    from skimage import io

    orig_phantom = img_as_ubyte(data.shepp_logan_phantom())
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.imshow(orig_phantom, cmap=plt.cm.gray)




.. image:: /auto_examples/applications/images/sphx_glr_plot_morphology_001.png
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img




Let's also define a convenience function for plotting comparisons:



.. code-block:: python



    def plot_comparison(original, filtered, filter_name):

        fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(ncols=2, figsize=(8, 4), sharex=True,
                                       sharey=True)
        ax1.imshow(original, cmap=plt.cm.gray)
        ax1.set_title('original')
        ax1.axis('off')
        ax2.imshow(filtered, cmap=plt.cm.gray)
        ax2.set_title(filter_name)
        ax2.axis('off')







Erosion
=======

Morphological ``erosion`` sets a pixel at (i, j) to the *minimum over all
pixels in the neighborhood centered at (i, j)*. The structuring element,
``selem``, passed to ``erosion`` is a boolean array that describes this
neighborhood. Below, we use ``disk`` to create a circular structuring
element, which we use for most of the following examples.



.. code-block:: python


    from skimage.morphology import erosion, dilation, opening, closing, white_tophat
    from skimage.morphology import black_tophat, skeletonize, convex_hull_image
    from skimage.morphology import disk

    selem = disk(6)
    eroded = erosion(orig_phantom, selem)
    plot_comparison(orig_phantom, eroded, 'erosion')




.. image:: /auto_examples/applications/images/sphx_glr_plot_morphology_002.png
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img




Notice how the white boundary of the image disappears or gets eroded as we
 increase the size of the disk. Also notice the increase in size of the two
 black ellipses in the center and the disappearance of the 3 light grey
 patches in the lower part of the image.

Dilation
========

Morphological ``dilation`` sets a pixel at (i, j) to the *maximum over all
pixels in the neighborhood centered at (i, j)*. Dilation enlarges bright
regions and shrinks dark regions.



.. code-block:: python


    dilated = dilation(orig_phantom, selem)
    plot_comparison(orig_phantom, dilated, 'dilation')




.. image:: /auto_examples/applications/images/sphx_glr_plot_morphology_003.png
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img




Notice how the white boundary of the image thickens, or gets dilated, as we
increase the size of the disk. Also notice the decrease in size of the two
black ellipses in the centre, and the thickening of the light grey circle
in the center and the 3 patches in the lower part of the image.

Opening
=======

Morphological ``opening`` on an image is defined as an *erosion followed by
a dilation*. Opening can remove small bright spots (i.e. "salt") and
connect small dark cracks.



.. code-block:: python


    opened = opening(orig_phantom, selem)
    plot_comparison(orig_phantom, opened, 'opening')




.. image:: /auto_examples/applications/images/sphx_glr_plot_morphology_004.png
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img




Since ``opening`` an image starts with an erosion operation, light regions
that are *smaller* than the structuring element are removed. The dilation
operation that follows ensures that light regions that are *larger* than
the structuring element retain their original size. Notice how the light
and dark shapes in the center their original thickness but the 3 lighter
patches in the bottom get completely eroded. The size dependence is
highlighted by the outer white ring: The parts of the ring thinner than the
structuring element were completely erased, while the thicker region at the
top retains its original thickness.

Closing
=======

Morphological ``closing`` on an image is defined as a *dilation followed by
an erosion*. Closing can remove small dark spots (i.e. "pepper") and
connect small bright cracks.

To illustrate this more clearly, let's add a small crack to the white
border:



.. code-block:: python


    phantom = orig_phantom.copy()
    phantom[10:30, 200:210] = 0

    closed = closing(phantom, selem)
    plot_comparison(phantom, closed, 'closing')




.. image:: /auto_examples/applications/images/sphx_glr_plot_morphology_005.png
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img




Since ``closing`` an image starts with an dilation operation, dark regions
that are *smaller* than the structuring element are removed. The dilation
operation that follows ensures that dark regions that are *larger* than the
structuring element retain their original size. Notice how the white
ellipses at the bottom get connected because of dilation, but other dark
region retain their original sizes. Also notice how the crack we added is
mostly removed.

White tophat
============

The ``white_tophat`` of an image is defined as the *image minus its
morphological opening*. This operation returns the bright spots of the
image that are smaller than the structuring element.

To make things interesting, we'll add bright and dark spots to the image:



.. code-block:: python


    phantom = orig_phantom.copy()
    phantom[340:350, 200:210] = 255
    phantom[100:110, 200:210] = 0

    w_tophat = white_tophat(phantom, selem)
    plot_comparison(phantom, w_tophat, 'white tophat')




.. image:: /auto_examples/applications/images/sphx_glr_plot_morphology_006.png
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img




As you can see, the 10-pixel wide white square is highlighted since it is
smaller than the structuring element. Also, the thin, white edges around
most of the ellipse are retained because they're smaller than the
structuring element, but the thicker region at the top disappears.

Black tophat
============

The ``black_tophat`` of an image is defined as its morphological **closing
minus the original image**. This operation returns the *dark spots of the
image that are smaller than the structuring element*.



.. code-block:: python


    b_tophat = black_tophat(phantom, selem)
    plot_comparison(phantom, b_tophat, 'black tophat')




.. image:: /auto_examples/applications/images/sphx_glr_plot_morphology_007.png
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img




As you can see, the 10-pixel wide black square is highlighted since
it is smaller than the structuring element.

**Duality**

As you should have noticed, many of these operations are simply the reverse
of another operation. This duality can be summarized as follows:

 1. Erosion <-> Dilation

 2. Opening <-> Closing

 3. White tophat <-> Black tophat

Skeletonize
===========

Thinning is used to reduce each connected component in a binary image to a
*single-pixel wide skeleton*. It is important to note that this is
performed on binary images only.



.. code-block:: python


    horse = data.horse()

    sk = skeletonize(horse == 0)
    plot_comparison(horse, sk, 'skeletonize')




.. image:: /auto_examples/applications/images/sphx_glr_plot_morphology_008.png
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img




As the name suggests, this technique is used to thin the image to 1-pixel
wide skeleton by applying thinning successively.

Convex hull
===========

The ``convex_hull_image`` is the *set of pixels included in the smallest
convex polygon that surround all white pixels in the input image*. Again
note that this is also performed on binary images.



.. code-block:: python


    hull1 = convex_hull_image(horse == 0)
    plot_comparison(horse, hull1, 'convex hull')




.. image:: /auto_examples/applications/images/sphx_glr_plot_morphology_009.png
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img




As the figure illustrates, ``convex_hull_image`` gives the smallest polygon
which covers the white or True completely in the image.

If we add a small grain to the image, we can see how the convex hull adapts
to enclose that grain:



.. code-block:: python


    import numpy as np

    horse_mask = horse == 0
    horse_mask[45:50, 75:80] = 1

    hull2 = convex_hull_image(horse_mask)
    plot_comparison(horse_mask, hull2, 'convex hull')




.. image:: /auto_examples/applications/images/sphx_glr_plot_morphology_010.png
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img
